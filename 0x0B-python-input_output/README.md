# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
### `Python`
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
### Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
## Tasks

[0. Read file](./0-read_file.py)

Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout:

* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
