# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output
### `Python`
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
### Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
* All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)`' and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case
## Tasks

[0. Read file](./0-read_file.py)

Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout:

* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

read_file("my_file_0.txt")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat my_file_0.txt

**No test cases needed**

[1. Write to a file](./1-write_file.py)

Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written:

* Prototype: `def write_file(filename="", text=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` exceptions.
* Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
* Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file

nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
print(nb_characters)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./1-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat my_first_file.txt
This School is so cool!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$
```
**No test cases needed**

[2. Append to a file](./2-append_write.py)

Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added:

* Prototype: `def append_write(filename="", text=""):`
* If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 2-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
append_write = __import__('2-append_write').append_write

nb_characters_added = append_write("file_append.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
print(nb_characters_added)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
cat: file_append.txt: No such file or directory
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./2-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
This School is so cool!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./2-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
This School is so cool!
This School is so cool!
