# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping
#### `Scripting` `API` `JavaScript`

## Resources

* [Working with JSON data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON#top-level_function)
* [The workflow of accessing the attributes of a simply-created JSON object by Jimmy Tran from Cohort 1 - San Francisco](https://medium.com/@vietkieutie/the-workflow-of-accessing-the-attributes-of-a-simply-created-json-object-82a5b33e2319)

### General
* Why JavaScript programming is amazing
* How to manipulate JSON data
* How to use `request` and fetch API
* How to read and write a file using `fs` module

## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu `14.04` LTS using `node` (version `10.14.x`)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should be `semistandard` compliant. [Rules of Standard](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) + [semicolons on top](https://github.com/standard/semistandard). Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
* You are not allowed to use `var`

## More Info
### Install Node 10
```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Install semi-standard
[Documentation](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)
```
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

### Install `request` module and use it
[Documentation](https://github.com/request/request)
```
$ sudo npm install request --global
$ export NODE_PATH=/usr/lib/node_modules
```
**Notes**: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).


## Tasks

[0. Readme](./0-readme.js)

Write a script that reads and prints the content of a file.

* The first argument is the file path
* The content of the file must be read in `utf-8`
* If an error occurred during the reading, print the error object
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ cat cisfun
C is super fun!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ ./0-readme.js cisfun
C is super fun!

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ ./0-readme.js doesntexist
{ Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'doesntexist'
    at Error (native)
  errno: -2,
  code: 'ENOENT',
  syscall: 'open',
  path: 'doesntexist' }
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$
```

[1. Write me](./1-writeme.js)

Write a script that writes a string to a file.

* The first argument is the file path
* The second argument is the string to write
* The content of the file must be written in `utf-8`
* If an error occurred during while writing, print the error object
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ ./1-writeme.js my_file.txt "Python is cool"
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ cat my_file.txt ; echo ""
Python is cool
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$
```

[2. Status code](./2-statuscode.js)

Write a script that display the status code of a `GET` request.

* The first argument is the URL to request (`GET`)
* The status code must be printed like this: `code: <status code>`
* You must use the module `request`
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ ./2-statuscode.js https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status
code: 200
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$ ./2-statuscode.js https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/doesnt_exist
code: 404
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x14$
```
